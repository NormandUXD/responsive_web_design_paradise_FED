  <h1>The Atmosphere</h1>
  <p>Surrounded by palm trees and overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the villa is shaped by its environment. Warm air, open spaces, and natural light outline the experience. It is a place meant to slow down time, where days begin with sunrise views and end with still evenings.
This website serves as a digital representation of the villa and the lifestyle connected to it.

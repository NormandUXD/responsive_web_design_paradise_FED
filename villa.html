      <h3>Villa Overview</h3>
      <p>This private family villa was designed with comfort and openness in mind. Rather than luxury for display, the focus has always been on providing livability, serenity, and connection to the surrounding environment.
        The layout feels open and relaxed, allowing fresh breeze to move through the space and making indoor and outdoor living feel connected, whether by the pool, on the balcony, or inside the living space.</p>
      <h3>The Space</h3>
      <p>Coastal Charm: A modern, open-concept villa designed for up to 6 guests, with fresh decor and soothing island vibes.</p>
      <p>Begin your day with Atlantic breezes, walk along nearby beaches, explore scenic trails, and return to a villa where comfort meets island style.</p>
